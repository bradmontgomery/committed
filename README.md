A project exploring python and Neo4j


What is this?
-------------

I'm just hacking stuff together at the moment. This project probably won't be
interesting for some time.


Getting Started
---------------

*These are mostly just notes to myself, at the moment.*

0. Prerequisites:
    * Create a python 3 virtual environment: `pyvenv-34 python`
    * Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * Download the Neo4j Community Edition (2.1.2)
1. Launch Neo4j (e.g. `./neo4j-community-2.1.2/bin/neo4j start`). This will also
   give you acess to Neo4j at [http://localhost:7474/](http://localhost:7474/).
2. Activate your venv (python 2 is still my default so I have to
   `unset PYTHONPATH && source python/bin/activate`)
3. Fire up ipython and play.
