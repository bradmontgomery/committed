A project exploring python and Neo4j


Getting Started
---------------

*These are mostly just notes to myself, at the moment.*

0. Prerequisites:
    * Create a python 3 virtual environment: `pyvenv-34 python`
    * Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * Download the Neo4j Community Edition (2.1.2)
1. Launch Neo4j, e.g. `./neo4j-community-2.1.2/bin/neo4j start`. This will also
   give you acess to Neo4j at [http://localhost:7474/](http://localhost:7474/).
2. `unset PYTHONPATH && source python/bin/activate`
